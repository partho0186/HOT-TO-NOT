            <h3>Motivation</h3>
            <p>Infuse your life with action. Don't wait for it to happen. Make it happen. Make your own future. Make
                your
                own
                hope. Make your own love. And whatever your beliefs, honor your creator, not by passively waiting for
                grace
                to
                come down from upon high, but by doing what you can to make grace happen... yourself, right now, right
                down
                here
                on Earth.</p>

            <h2>Educational quotes</h2>
            <p>I spent three days a week for 10 years educating myself in the public library, and it's better than
                college.
                People should educate themselves - you can get a complete education for no money. At the end of 10
                years, I
                had read every book in the library and I'd written a thousand stories.

                Ray Bradbury</p>
